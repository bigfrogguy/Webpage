Using both R and Python at the same time can be something really fun. To show you, I'm gonna run the reticulate library to allow these different languages to communicate. Starting with R, I'm gonna assign this string of characters to "TheHonest".
```{r}
library(reticulate)
TheHonest <- "Kate Bush's 1982 record The Dreaming"
```

Next, switching to python, I'm going to save this string of characters to "Truth". Finally, I'm going to print out the result of both of these strings in this python code chunk using the print function.

```{python}
Truth = "is one of the best albums I've ever heard"
print(r.TheHonest, Truth)
```

As a result, we can conclude that Kate Bush's 1982 record The Dreaming is one of the best albums I've ever heard.

Now we're gonna try and run some numbers. Let's beging by creating a string of numbers to use. I'll just create a vector of numbers of what I expect to see 10 different people rate The Dreaming By Kate Bush.

```{R}
ratings <- c(9, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10, 10, 9.5, 9.5, 10)
mean(ratings)
```

So by importing numpy and calculating the mean, we get an average score of 9.7, truly remarkable. I, an avid believer in rounding, see that as a 10/10. Now let's see if we can do the same thing in R and get the same result using that strong of numbers.

```{python}
import numpy as np
np.mean(r.ratings)
```

And look at that! Another 9.7 we're gonna squint and call a 10! Looks to me like R and Python both have the right idea. If you aren't listening to Suspended in Gaffa and relating to the lyrics a little *too* much, then what are you listening to?
